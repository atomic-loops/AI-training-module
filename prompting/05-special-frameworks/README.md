# Module 5: Special Prompting Frameworks

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting
- Zero-shot and Few-shot learning
- Role-based prompting strategies
- Structured output generation
- ROSE (Rules Observation) framework
- Other specialized frameworks

## 📚 Available Frameworks

This module contains detailed guides for specialized prompting frameworks:

### Core Frameworks
- [Chain of Thought (CoT)](./chain-of-thought/README.md) - Step-by-step reasoning
- [Zero-shot Prompting](./zero-shot/README.md) - No-example prompting
- [Few-shot Prompting](./few-shot/README.md) - Learning from examples
- [Role-based Prompting](./role-based/README.md) - Persona-driven prompts
- [Structured Output](./structured-output/README.md) - Format-controlled generation

### Advanced Frameworks
- [ROSE (Rules Observation)](./ROSE-framework.md) - Rule-following framework
- Tree of Thoughts - Multi-path reasoning
- ReAct - Reasoning and Acting
- Self-Consistency - Multiple reasoning paths

## 🔄 Framework Comparison

| Framework | Best For | Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Chain of Thought | Reasoning tasks | Medium | Math, logic problems |
| Zero-shot | General tasks | Low | Quick responses |
| Few-shot | Pattern learning | Medium | Consistent formatting |
| Role-based | Specialized tasks | Low | Domain expertise |
| Structured Output | Data extraction | Low | APIs, parsing |
| ROSE | Rule compliance | High | Legal, compliance |

## 🎯 When to Use Which Framework

### Chain of Thought
- ✅ Multi-step problems
- ✅ Mathematical reasoning
- ✅ Logical puzzles
- ✅ Need to see reasoning process

### Zero-shot
- ✅ Simple, direct tasks
- ✅ General knowledge questions
- ✅ Quick responses needed
- ✅ No examples available

### Few-shot
- ✅ Need specific format
- ✅ Pattern recognition
- ✅ Consistent output style
- ✅ Learning from examples

### Role-based
- ✅ Domain-specific knowledge
- ✅ Professional tone needed
- ✅ Expert perspective required
- ✅ Specialized terminology

### Structured Output
- ✅ API integration
- ✅ Data extraction
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Machine-readable output

### ROSE
- ✅ Rule compliance
- ✅ Legal documents
- ✅ Policy adherence
- ✅ Regulatory requirements
