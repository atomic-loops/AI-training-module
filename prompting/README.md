# 🎯 Prompting Styles & Techniques Playbook

A comprehensive guide to effective prompting for AI models, covering basic styles, advanced techniques, model-specific optimizations, and special frameworks.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview

This playbook is designed as a structured learning path for developers, data scientists, and AI practitioners to master the art of prompting. Each module builds upon the previous one, providing both theoretical knowledge and practical examples.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this playbook, you will:
- Understand fundamental prompting principles
- Master basic and advanced prompting styles
- Learn model-specific optimization techniques
- Apply special prompting frameworks (ROSE, Chain of Thought, etc.)
- Create effective prompts for different use cases

## 🧠 How to Use This Playbook

This playbook can be used in several ways depending on your experience level, goals, and available time:

### Learning Paths

1. **Complete Beginner Path (10-15 hours)**
   - Work through all modules sequentially
   - Practice with examples in each module
   - Time commitment: 1-2 hours per module

2. **Experienced User Path (5-8 hours)**
   - Start with [Module 2: Basic Prompting Styles](./02-basic-prompting-styles/README.md)
   - Focus on model-specific optimizations
   - Refer to earlier modules as needed for review
   - Time commitment: 1 hour per module

3. **Quick Reference (As needed)**
   - Bookmark the [Quick Reference Guide](./reference/README.md)
   - Use model-specific guides for your target model
   - Refer to special frameworks as needed
