# 🔢 NumPy Playbook

A comprehensive NumPy curriculum for data scientists and developers, covering everything from basics to advanced array operations and numerical computing.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview

This playbook is designed as a structured learning path for developers and data scientists to master NumPy. Each module builds upon the previous one, providing both theoretical knowledge and practical examples.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this playbook, you will:
- Understand NumPy fundamentals and array operations
- Master array creation, manipulation, and indexing
- Implement efficient numerical computations
- Work with multi-dimensional arrays effectively
- Optimize performance using NumPy's vectorized operations

## 🧠 How to Use This Playbook

This playbook can be used in several ways depending on your experience level, goals, and available time:

### Learning Paths

1. **Complete Beginner Path (15-20 hours)**
   - Work through all modules sequentially
   - Complete all exercises in each module
   - Time commitment: 2-3 hours per module

2. **Experienced Developer Path (8-12 hours)**
   - Start with [Module 3: Essentials](./03-essentials/README.md)
   - Focus on advanced topics and optimization
   - Refer to earlier modules as needed for review
   - Time commitment: 1-2 hours per module

3. **Quick Reference (As needed)**
   - Bookmark the [Quick Reference Guide](./reference/README.md)
   - Use the [Cheat Sheet](./reference/cheat-sheet.md) and [Troubleshooting Guide](./reference/troubleshooting.md)
   - Refer to specific sections as issues arise

### Suggested Study Methods

- **Individual Learning**: Set aside dedicated time each week (2-3 hours) to work through one module
- **Pair Learning**: Work through modules with a colleague, discussing concepts and helping each other
- **Practice Projects**: Create a sandbox notebook to practice concepts from each module
